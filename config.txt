Web Browsers: Many web browsers have an "about:config" or similar feature that allows users to access advanced settings and preferences. In Firefox, for example, typing "about:config" in the address bar lets you access a wide range of browser configuration options, some of which are not available through the regular settings menu. These settings can be used to tweak the browser's behavior, performance, and security.
